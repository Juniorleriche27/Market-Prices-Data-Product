# Market Prices Project

Small data product to monitor food market prices in West Africa.
The app generates sample data, cleans it, computes data quality metrics,
and offers AI-assisted economic insights.

## Structure
- `app.py` : Streamlit app (pipeline + dashboard + AI analysis).
- `data/raw/` : raw generated data.
- `data/clean/` : cleaned data.
- `data/product/` : final dataset used by the dashboard.
- `docs/` : reports (AI analysis is saved here).
- `logs/` : execution logs (if added later).

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set your API key (optional if you do not use AI analysis):

```bash
set GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

You can also place the key in `.env`:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

## Run

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Data folders role
- `data/raw/` : raw data generated by the pipeline.
- `data/clean/` : cleaned and standardized dataset.
- `data/product/` : final dataset with ingestion date for reporting.
